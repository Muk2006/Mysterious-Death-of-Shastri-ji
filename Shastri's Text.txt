He had taken the documents from the KGB Archives. He used&nbsp;to take these document secretly in his shoes for 25 years. He had secret document of all the countries. During the Cold War the whole world was divided under the KGB and CIA. So after the war between Pakistan&nbsp;and India in 1965. Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President&nbsp;Ayub Khan meet tin Tashkent for an agreement on 10 January&nbsp;1966 and on that night Lal Bahadur Shastri died unfortunately. Even after 50 years we don't know that he died due to Heart Attack or it was a murder. Shastri's family filled an application against the Foreign Minister during that time because a Prime Minister of another country has died in another and no proper information was given to the country nor to the the Lal Bahadur Shastri's family. All the information relating to his relating to his death are available&nbsp;in the public domain which runs up to 5,000 pages. But did the Indian National Congress government&nbsp;ruling that time has nothing about relating to Shastri's death. Its not about the Shastri its about the government&nbsp;lets pin the government&nbsp;during 1966 when Indira Gandhi was the prime Minister. Lal Bahadur Shastri Independent&nbsp;India's 2 Prime Minister dies immediately&nbsp;in Tashkent after the war.&nbsp; Thousands of suspicious and doubts were raised some claimed that he was poised and so claimed that he had a Natural Death but here is no proof. What was the government&nbsp;trying to hid us from. What is the conspiracy&nbsp;behind&nbsp;Shastri Death.</b></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>Shastri was only 16 years when he took part in the Gandhi's Satyagraha. He was a true Gandhian. During the war Shastri used to visit&nbsp;the Border and used to meet the soldiers. Shastri had already&nbsp;had 2-3 times heart attack. In Tashkent&nbsp;last movement Shastri was to told to stay in a Dancha a Russian word for a Bungalow. That Dancha had a mini-operation theater&nbsp;and also Oxygen cylinder&nbsp;tanks. The staff of Lal Bahadur Shastri's was 250 yards. The heart patient who has already suffered 2 heart attacks has no Oxygen Tanks in his room. There is something called official protocol. There are some facts that after signing the Pact in Tashkent Shastri returned to his residence and he was in a good mood he was having a good health. He spoke over the telephone with his family members in Delhi. He went to bed around 12:30 am in midnight. On the 11 Janurary the same day around 1:20 Mr.Sahai Kapoor and Dr. Sharma approached&nbsp;to the Prime Minister who was in the next room and told him that the Prime Minister was not feeling well. Dr. Chug once approached&nbsp;the Prime Minister who was sitting on his bed coughing and was complaining of lack of breath. The doctor put Prime Minister in a reclining position and gave him a intermuscular&nbsp;injection after 3 mins the Prime Minister lost consciousness, pulse disappear&nbsp;and breathing stopped and heartbeat stopped. The death occurred&nbsp;at 1:32am in the morning of 11 Jan 1966. After which 6 doctors arrived&nbsp;the spot followed by the a lady doctor named Yeremenko. They all arrived&nbsp;on the scene examined the patient and declared&nbsp;that Mr. Shastri was no longer breathing. Then 2 reports&nbsp;were made 1 report was given to the Indian Government&nbsp;and another one was for the USSR government. There was no bell in Shastri's room. The reports contains the signature of 6 doctors excluding Dr.R,N.Chug. But there were 8 doctors. There was no signature&nbsp;of Home Minister and Foreign Minister of Parliament. The senior doctor Dr.E.G.Yeremenko arrived&nbsp;on the spot first. Why was her signature not there. Why&nbsp;was Oxygen not given to Shastri.&nbsp;</b></span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><b>In reports states that an Intramuscular Injection, Artificial Respiration and massage was given but why not Intertublar Oxygen was not given to a heart patient who already suffered 2 heart attack.

So people say Lal Bahadur Shastri death is digging up old graves. I am asking the UPA government&nbsp;during the that time that Lal Bahadur Shastri death was a natural death or was it a state sponsored murder.&nbsp;</b></span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;"><b>This was during the Cold War America was spreading Democracy&nbsp;and Capitalism all over the world while the USSR was spreading&nbsp;socialism and communalism. All the countries on the US sides were the allies of US and the countries on the USSR side were allies of USSR. This Cold War was not between some armies it was being run by KGB and CIA. In the 1970's it was the era was spies and India was the most important country for these 2 agencies. The CIA philosophy&nbsp;was if you want to enslave any country just buy the country. But KGB believed&nbsp;that if you control peoples mind then they will become your salve. This was not possible as long as Shastri was alive. Lal Bahadur Shastri's 2 medical reports were made. Anil Shastri son of Lal Bahadur Shastri told that Shastri ji's Red Diary did not&nbsp;came back. He used to record day-day event in it. Lalita Shastri said that the the Flask in which Shastri ji used to drink milk did not&nbsp;returned. During his death Shastri was pointing towards the Flask which means the contents in the Flask had done this&nbsp;condition to Shastri that means there would had been some kind of poison in Shastri's Flask. Why </b></span></span><span style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;">the forensic investigation done to the room where Shastri was staying even his bottle. And one more thing </b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;"><b>usually</b></span><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;">&nbsp;Shastri cook used to give food or even milk to Shastri but that day Jaan Mohammad gave milk to Shastri. Why Jaan Mohammad why not Shastri's cook. After Shastri's death Shastri's cook was killed in a car accident and also the only </b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;"><b>witness</b></span><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;">&nbsp;Dr.Chug was also killed in a car </b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;"><b>accident</b></span><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;">. This is not a coincident. It is a state sponsored murder by the UPA </b><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;"><b>Government</b></span><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;"><b>As I told you there were 2 medical reports one for the Indian Government and another for USSR Government which were 2 different medical reports. In one report it was written that the death was due to infrak-Myocardiac and in another medical report it was written that the death was due to Myocardiac-Infraction. It also stated that in one reports that he was given glucose, adrenaline and potassium chloride and in other report that he was given glucose, adrenaline and calcium chloride. Only 6 doctors signed in the Indian Report and 8 doctors signed in the USSR Report. 2 more doctors signed in the USSR Report which were Dr.Shamirzen and Dr.E.G.Yeremenko 2 senior doctors who first came to the spot. She could not revive Mr. Shastri&nbsp;&nbsp;when Dr.Kosygin asked Dr.Yeremenko why she couldn't&nbsp;revive she stated that this is only possible that if Shastri died due to heart attack. She was in doubt which is why she signed the USSR Report. During the parliament&nbsp;proceeding&nbsp;in 16 Feb 1966 the foreign minister Swaran Singh gave a statement that he included the medical report but how did the report when missing. The UPA Government killed 2 times one in real life and second time systemically. I am shameful&nbsp;to be a youth of a country that I don't Lal Bahadur Shastri was also born on 2 October. Our education system only concentrated on the people who wanted partition not the people who wanted unity. We are only thought about Gandhi's and Nehru's we are not thought about Shastri, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev, Lala Lajpat Rai who have also sacrifice&nbsp;their lives</b></span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;"><b>It was a conspiracy&nbsp;that Shubhas Chandra Bose was also present in Tashkent Pact. I want to tell something that a High Ranking CIA officer Robert Crowley gave an interview to Gregory Douglas. In that interview he was talking about Bhabha was travelling to Vienna on a 747 Boeing&nbsp;airplane when an explosion occurred&nbsp;that in the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; plane cargo section. The plane and it's passenger disappeared. Crowley said that there was no real evidence and world will become a safer place. We are talking about America the biggest country in the country and CIA who killed our scientist to make the world a safer place. This is Democracy. Douglas&nbsp;asked Crowley a question and he replied&nbsp;and said a cow lovely stupid leader. Lal Bahadur Shastri a stupid Leader. They also said that they nailed Shastri. This is worlds&nbsp; biggest country Democracy. Killing leaders.&nbsp;</b></span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;"><span style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><b>When the body of Shastri reached India it was swollen and the color was changed to black. There were numerous cut stains on the body this could mean that the body. Even the post mortem was not conducted to satisfy the family as they had already asked it. The members in the parliament&nbsp;had discuss&nbsp;about this&nbsp;incidents of&nbsp;cuts in the body but then a White Paper was issued&nbsp;if the White Paper is the last word then after 50 years the Times Now News Channel has showed a report. Which was fake according to me because no proper stamp or seal was on the paper. Parliament&nbsp;is the "Temple of Democracy" so in this&nbsp;"Temple of Democracy" where many veteran leaders like KN Singh, HV Kamath, Krishna Kath, Atal Bihari Vajpayee demanded this "Temple of Democracy" for a judicial inquiry then wasn't it granted to them but instead they were put in jail why because they wanted truth and the UPA Government was scared. Now about Jaan Mohammad he was the cook only for that day when Shastri died usallly Shastri's cook Ramnath used to cook food for Shastri and used to give Shastri milk why Jaan Mohammad that day. What is the conspiracy is it a plan to the Opposition Government&nbsp;during Shastri leadership. Socialism word was not added until&nbsp;Shastri was alive. As Shastri died this word Socialism word was added in the Constitution&nbsp;of India and also during the Emergency&nbsp;is it a coincidence. This was not possible if Shastri was alive. This&nbsp;all was done when the "Great Nehru's daughter became the Prime Minister." As Shastri died India became a colony again. Dr. Baba Ramji Ambedkar also did not&nbsp;wanted the word Socialism to be added in the Constitution. Democracy was murder when this word "Socialism" was added. During emergency&nbsp;our socialist leaders, intellectuals&nbsp;and journalist were in jail and this&nbsp;incident took place. Again UPA Government.&nbsp;</b></span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;"><span style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><b>When USSR was split up in 1992 Mitrokhin gave 25,000 secret documents to Britain&nbsp;after which the Mitrokhen committee&nbsp;was formed and cases were filed against the corrupts&nbsp;officers. There was one more chapter which was about India. Mitrokhen reports are considered&nbsp;the world best books in which it was written that the "Whole country was for sale" India was for sale. If Shastri was alive would India still be for sale? Is this why Shastri was prisoned? Is this&nbsp;why post mortem was not conducted? To put in our forehead that India was for sale? In the 1970 India had a status that India is Disneyland to spies Disney land means assessment&nbsp;park. KGB had more spies in India then around the world. Around which 21 were political leaders. I want to say something&nbsp;that A top leader Codename VANO was sent a suitcases of money by KGB on a occasion a secret gift of 2,000,000. Another 1,000,000 rupees&nbsp;were given on the same occasion to newspaper supporting&nbsp;the top leader. In 1978 the KGB was running over agents in India the biggest number in the world. Is selling the security of our country Nationalism? During 1970 10 years later media, journalist, politician, historian etc were under payroll of KGB is this Nationalism. The top leader codenamed VANO was none other than Indira Gandhi "Daughter of Great Nehru."</b></span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;"><span style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><b>I just wanted to say that this&nbsp;all information is available&nbsp;in the public domain.</b></span></span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><br /></p>
